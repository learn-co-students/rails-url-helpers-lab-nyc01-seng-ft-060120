# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])


#  "students", t.string   "first_name", t.string   "last_name"


# 10.times do
# Student.create([
#     {first_name: Faker::TvShows::HeyArnold.character, last_name: Faker::TvShows::DrWho.villain }
#     ])
# end
